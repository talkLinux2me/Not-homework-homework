<p>This is a paragraph. 
    In order for this to be considered a paragraph, we must have at least 3 sentences.
    Do we have 3 sentences yet? I changed the image size from the original to 100 px. They are cute images! 
</p>

<p>This is a second paragraph. How many sentences should a second paragraph have? Should it be the same amount of sentences as the first paragraph? I'm not sure. I hope this takes up enough space!</p>
